;; # Evaluation in linear temporal logic LTL

;; Models in LTL are Kripke structures      
;; A formula of LTL is true in a Kripke structure, if it's true for all
;; paths beginning at the initial state of the Kripke structure


;; Evaluation of a LTL formula in a Kripke structure is model checking.     

;; The steps for checking if the Kripke structure `ks` fulfills the formula `phi` are:

;; 1. Construct a Büchi automaton corresponding to the given Kripke structure `ks`.
;; 2. Take the negation `(not phi)` of the formula and translate it to a Büchi automaton.
;; 3. Build the synchronized product of the two automaton. A successful run
;;    in the product corresponds to the initial runs of `ks`  satisfying `(not phi)`.
;;    Thus: if the product is empty, `phi` is true in `ks` otherwise the product
;;    automaton gives a counterexample.
