;; # Satisfiability in linear temporal logic

;; The basic steps are:

;; 1. Generate a B端chi automaton for the formula of LTL that has the property
;;    that the infinite words accepted by the automaton i.e. the language of the
;;    automaton are exactly the set of computations satisfying the formula.
;; 2. If the B端chi automaton is not empty, the formula is satisfiable, and we
;;    construct a model, i.e. a Kripke structure for the formula.

;; #### Helper functions

(defn node-label
  "Label for a node with `id` with edge from `from` in the Kripke structure for the automaton `ba`."
  [ba from id]
  (let [edge (ba/ids->edge ba from id)
        guard (:guard edge)]
    (if (set? guard)
      (set/select symbol? guard)
      #{})))

(defn- node-key
  "Keyword for a node with `id`"
  [id]
  (keyword (str "s_" id)))

;; #### Transformation of B端chi automaton into a corresponding Kripke structure

;; The idea:        

;; 1. We determine a path from the init node of the automaton to a cycle that contains
;;    an accepting state
;; 2. Then we use this path to construct a Kripke structure.

(defn ba->ks
  "A Kripke structure is generated from a B端chi automaton as a model       
   for the formula the automaton accepts."
  [ba]
  (let [literals (reduce set/union (filter set? (map :guard (:edges ba))))
        atoms (set (map #(if (list? %) (second %) %) literals)) 
        pathv (first (ba/paths ba))
        nodes (mapv #(hash-map (node-key %2) (node-label ba %1 %2)) pathv (rest pathv))
        nodes' (apply merge-with set/union nodes)
        initial (node-key (second pathv))
        pathv' (if (ba/accepting? ba (second pathv)) (conj pathv (second pathv)) pathv)
        edges (set (map #(vector (node-key %1) (node-key %2)) (rest pathv') (rest (rest pathv'))))
