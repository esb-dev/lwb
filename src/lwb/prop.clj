;; # Propositional logic

;; The namespace `lwb.prop` provides

;; * syntax
;;     - operators of propositional logic
;;     - checking whether a formula is well-formed
;;     - visualizing the syntax tree of a formula
;; * models and evaluation
;;     - specification of a model in propositional logic
;;     - evaluation of formulas in a given model
;;     - the truth table for a formula

;; ## Syntax of formulas of propositional logic

;; The propositional atoms are represented by Clojure symbols, 
;; e.g. `P` or `Q`. Operators, the constants `true` and `false`, and
;; symbols beginning with `ts-` are not allowed as atoms.

;; The propositional constants for truth (_verum_) and falsity (_falsum_) are represented
;; by `true` and `false`, respectively.

;; A propositional formula is an atom or a constant, or an expression composed
;; of boolean operators, propositional atoms and constants in the usual
;; lispy syntax, e.g. `(impl (and P (not P)) Q)`.

;; ### The operators of propositional logic

;; * `not`:   Negation - unary
;; * `and`:   Conjunction  -- n-ary
;; * `or`:    Disjunction  -- n-ary
;; * `impl`:  Implication  --  binary
;; * `equiv`: Equivalence  -- binary
;; * `xor`:   Exclusive or -- binary
;; * `ite`:  If-then-else  -- ternary

(defmacro impl
  "Logical implication."
  [phi psi]
  (list 'or
        (list 'not phi) psi))

(defmacro equiv
  "Logical equivalence."
  [phi psi]
  (list 'and

(defmacro xor

        (list 'equiv phi psi)))

(defmacro ite
  "Logical if-then-else."
  [i t e]
  (list 'or (list 'and i t)
        (list 'and (list 'not i) e)))

;; *Remark*: The definitions of the operators may not be changed to functions.
;; In the transformation of a formula to cnf it is useful and necessary that the operators
;; are defined as macros

;; ### Well-formed formulas

;; We can see a formula from the syntactic perspective as a finite sequence of
;; atoms, operators and parentheses that conform to the grammar of propositional logic.
