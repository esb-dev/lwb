;; # The language of predicate logic

;; There are actually many languages of predicate logic, which are
;; defined with respect to a given signature of the non-logical symbols.

;; ## Signatures

;; A signature for a language of predicate logic comprises the definition
;; of

;; * constants (which can be seen as functions with arity 0),
;; * functions together with their arity,
;; * propositions (which can be seen as predicates with arity 0)
;; * predicates with their arity

;; Signatures are represented in Clojure as maps.
;; The items in the map are pairs of symbols and specification of the
;; type (predicate or function) together with the arity.
;; Constants do not habe to be specified, they are keywords or integers.

;; ### Specification of a signature

  "Is `symb` an allowed symbol  predicates or functions in predicate logic?"
  [symb]

    (and (symbol? symb) (not (op? symb)) (not (contains? not-ok symb)))))

(s/def ::signature (s/map-of sig-symb? (s/tuple #{:pred :func} nat-int?)))

;; Example:

;;        {'f [:func  2]
;;         'A [:pred  0]
;;         'P [:pred  1]}

;; defines a signature comprising the binary function `f`,
;; the proposition `A`, and the unary predicate `P`.

;; Constants are represented as keywords or ints in Clojure. Thus it's not necessary
;; to declare them in the signature.

;; ## Models

;; A model is a "world" consisting of a universe, as well as functions and relations 
;; on the universe. A model assigns concrete functions and relations to the
;; function symbols and relation symbols defined in a signature.

;; Models are represented in Clojure as maps:

;; The key `:univ` denotes the universe, the value is a set of constants

;; Functions are given by symbol for the function, 
;; together with a vector consisting of the keyword `:func`, the arity of the
;; function and the function itsself.

;; Propositions are given by symbol for the
;; proposition together with a vector consisting of the keyword `:pred`,
;; the arity `0` and the value for the proposition i.e. `true` or `false`.   

;; Relations are given by the symbol for the corresponding
;; predicate symbol together with a vector consisting of the keyword `:pred`, 
;; the arity of the relation and a predicate constructed by `make-pred` from
;; the provided relation.

;; Example for a group of 2 elements:

;;     {:univ #{0 1}
;;      'op   [:func 2 (fn [x y] (body of function for group operation))]
;;      'inv  [:func 1 (fn [x] (body of function for inverse))]
;;      'unit [:func 0 0]}

;; see lwb.pred.examples.groups

;; Example for a family:

;;      {:univ #{:eve :adam :joe :susan :anne}
;;       'mother [:pred 2 '(fn [mother child] 
;;                             (let [rel #{[:eve :joe] [:eve :susan] [:susan :anne]}]
;;                                                (contains? rel [mother child])))]}

;; **Caveat reader!**         
;; Formulas of predicate logic can be evaluated with respect to a model.
;; In Clojure the model is used in a let-binding.

;; This may result in some subtle problems, see the following comments
(comment 
  
  (defn my-eval [avec phi]
    (eval `(let ~avec ~phi)))
  
  ; The idea of my-eval is the evaluation of
  ; arbitrary lists where the symbols are
  ; defined in avec.

  ; example:     
  ; in avec the symbol p is defined as true
  ; and the symbol foo as a function adding 2

  (def avec
    ['p   true
     'foo (fn [x] (+ 2 x))])

  ; and here their evaluation
  (my-eval avec '(and p (= 7 (foo 5))))
  ; => true
  
  ; If the function in the assignment vector is a clojure
  ; we get an exception:

  (defn make-adder [n]
    (fn [x] (+ n x)))

  ((make-adder 2) 5)
  ; => 7

  ; here the second definition of a binding vector:
  (def avec'
    ['p true
     'foo (make-adder 2)])

  (my-eval avec' '(and p (= 7 (foo 5))))
  ; CompilerException java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
  
  ; There is a ticket concerning this behaviour: 
  ; [Clojure/CLJ-1206](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1206).
  
  ; It's not always possible to eval function objects in Clojure
  
  ; If running into this problem, don't use the function object,
  ; but the code that defines the function:
  
  (def avec''
    '[p true
      foo (make-adder 2)])
  (my-eval avec'' '(and p (= 7 (foo 5))))
  ; => true
